                        &emsp; I’m sooo sorryy for the misunderstanding babyyyy. I didn't mean to hurt you babyyyy, I only wanted you to understand that I want us to be forever and we have to be mature. You have to be strong and independent when I'm not around babyyyy. I'm always your babyyyy, you can let your babyyyy side go out everytime I'm by your side babyyyy. Don't make me feel like everyone is treated the same as how you treat me babyyyy. I want us to be healthy babyyy. I'm sorry again for being cold babyyyy. I didn't mean to and I'm really sorry if you looked it that way babyyyy, it's entirely my fault for making you feel those ways. I'm sorry for the words that hurt you babyyyy, I only wanted you to understand.
